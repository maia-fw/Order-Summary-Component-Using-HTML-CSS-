## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- How to center a div on a webpage
- Using Figma at the same time and having the right info available to me as I was coding

### Continued development

What do I need to work on still/what were my issues?
  - responsive design, going from mobile to desktop and vice-versa
  - the code is a bit broken when you go down to the mobile version
  - at 375px the code is a bit wonky and I was having trouble trying to figure out    how to fix that
